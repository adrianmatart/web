	The warming spice cinnamon has been valued for its culinary, medicinal, and natural preservative powers since ancient times. First described by Shen Nung, the father of Chinese Medicine, circa 2800 BC, ancient Egyptians used cinnamon as part of the mummification process.

In the first century CE, Europeans treasured the spice so much that they paid 15 times more for it than silver.1 Cinnamon is actually the brown bark of the cinnamon tree. It can be found in quill form (the dried “stick” variety) or ground as a fine powder.

Rich in essential oil, cinnamon contains active components including cinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, and cinnamyl alcohol, which account for some of its many therapeutic benefits.
